Adjusting date window:

1 Month gives better results consistently

2-3 months
equal to actual returns for a good amount with being better after halfway through 2018

4-5 is equal to expect for worse results from 2019-2020

6-7 have same results as well with being equal until worse 2019-2020 but then far outpaces actual after

8-9 is mostly worst, expect for 9 has  slightly better results from 2018-2019

10 is consistently worse

11- 17 months  give exact same as actual returns

18-19 gives same until 2020 which then outpaces actual

20 is slightly worse from halfway 2018-2019 until outpaces it 2020 onward

21 is worse from 2018-2020 then same again

22 is equal until starts being worse at halfway 2018 until 2020 then outpaces

23 equal until 2018 then worse until 2020 outpaces

24-25 equal until halfway 2020 then outpaces

26-68 months equal with actual

Best offset amount of time seems to be 19. 19 actual outpaces 18 by quite a bit.

Changing windows best I could do was 3 months offset with 4, 75. Returns were above actual returns in backtest
However, having 4, 100 with 19 months offset was still better. Didn't have much luck getting signifanct results with changing the window.
Would get mostly results that would be the same as actual, sometimes worse, rarely better. 


Overall best results was having default window with enddatae being offset by 19 months.

The last testing we tried was using a new model. For this we used logistic regression. As we can see from the graph below,
the model did out preform the actual return until 2021 where it does signifcantely worse. 

Overall though, the default parameters for the svr model outperforms the logistic regression model.
